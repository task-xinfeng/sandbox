General Principles  
1. The extent to which antifraud services is provided will depend on these key
criteria: (i) importance / value of the product / channel; (ii) inherent risk of
the product / channel; (iii) business’s risk tolerance.   
2. In the provision of antifraud support, our utmost priority is depth rather
than breadth (quality rather than quantity). As such, we aim to focus our
limited antifraud resources, and commit to a high level of support, on the most
important and highest risk channels.   
3. We believe in 'risk management by-design' - this means that the business
should always consider a business model, contractual agreements and product
design that gives the highest reward-to-risk trade-off. Business should consider
factors such as the type of transactions they process, the volume of
transactions, and the level of fraud risk associated with those transactions.   
4. We will maintain a flexible and nimble stance, responding to the evolving and
changing trends and needs of the business. The risk prioritization plan will
evolve and change according to the growth of products / channels, or changes in
risk and compliance environment (incidents, new attack MO, new regulations,
etc.). As such, communication between the business and risk teams is critical.

give antifraud suggestions through comments in the project documents, but we
will not implement actual antifraud protection.   
If the business was impacted by risk incidents. Antifraud will assist the
business to investigate (to the best of available data) and re-evaluate, or
re-integrate with risk system to provide protection.  
  
Med Level (46)  
The projects that are marked as Med level mainly include:  
1. New Payment Channels or Payment Channels that save us no more than 50K per
month.  
2. All P1, P2 projects of Credit products  
3. All P0 projects of DG and Finance products  
  
  
Low Level  
No support at initial stage, until business grows to a sizable volume or
impacted by risk incidents. It requires re-evaluation and re-integrate with Risk
systems to provide Antifraud protection.  
  
Low Level: (46)  
The projects that are marked as Low level mainly include: All P1, P2 projects of

Please Note: For the DG and Finance businesses that are not included in high or
Med, we don’t have to worry too much. Since they are new products or business
models on e-commerce platforms, the payment process still relies on various
payment channels. Therefore, they may already be covered by risk control
naturally.
